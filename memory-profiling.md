## Theory

### Objects

[read](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/javascript-memory-profiling#object-sizes)

#### Shallow size

- memory held by object **itself**
- arrays and strings may have significant shallow size

#### Retaines size

- memory that is freed once object itself is deleted due to it becoming unreachable from *GC roots*
- held by object *implicitly*

##### GC roots

- made up of *handles* that are created when making a reference from native code to a JS object ouside of v8
- found in heap snapshot under **GC roots > Handle scope** and **GC roots > Global handles**
- internal GC roots are window global object and DOM tree

#### Storage

[read](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/javascript-memory-profiling#javascript-object-representation)

[read](https://github.com/thlorenz/v8-perf/blob/master/data-types.md)

- primitives are leafs or terminating nodes
- strings stored in *VM heap* or externally (accessible via *wrapper object*)
- *VM heap* is heap dedicated to JS objects and managed byt v8 gargabe collector
- *native objects* stored outside of *VM heap*, not managed by v8 garbage collector and are accessed via JS *wrapper
  object* 
- *cons string* object created by concatenating strings, consists of pairs of strings that are only joined as needed
- *arrays* objects with numeric keys, used to store large amount of data, i.e. hashtables (key-value-pair sets) are
  backed by arrays
- *map* object describing object kind and layout

#### Object Groups

[read](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/javascript-memory-profiling#object-groups)

- *native objects* group is made up from objects holding mutual references to each other
- not represented in JS heap -> have zero size
- wrapper objects created instead, each holding reference to corresponding *native object*
- object group holds wrapper objects creating a cycle
- GC releases object groups whose wrapper objects aren't referenced, but holding on to single wrapper will hold whole
  group of associated wrappers

### Retainers

[read](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/javascript-memory-profiling#objects-retaining-tree)

- shown at the  bottom inside heap snapshots UI 
- *nodes/objects* labelled by name of constructor function used to build them
- *edges* labelled using property names 

### Dominators

[read](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/javascript-memory-profiling#dominators)

- can be seen in [**Dominators** view](#dominators-view)
- tree structure in which each object has **one** dominator
- if *dominator* is deleted the *dominated* node is no longer reachable from *GC root*

### Causes for Leaks

- logical errors in JS that keep references to objects that aren't needed anymore
- this causes an object to be considered live by the GC and thus prevents it from being reclaimed

## Tools

### DevTools Timeline

[read](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/javascript-memory-profiling#identifying-a-memory-problem-with-the-devtools-timeline)

- not available to use with Node.js afaik until a tool is created that generates the data used by this view

### DevTools Heap Profiler

[read](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/javascript-memory-profiling#heap-profiler)

#### Collecting a HeapDump for a Node.js app

- the [heapdump](https://github.com/bnoordhuis/node-heapdump) module supports Node.js `v0.6-v0.10`
- `require('heapdump')` in your module and cause it to write a heap snapshot via `kill -USR2 <pid>` 
- before a heap dump is taken, v8 [performs two GC
  cycles](https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/21f01f64c420fffdb917c9890d03f1eb0c2c1ede/src/heap-snapshot-generator.cc#L2594-L2599)
  (also for [Node.js
  `v0.10`](https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/v0.10.29-release/deps/v8/src/profile-generator.cc#L3091-L3096))in order
  to remove collectable objects
- objects in the resulting heapdump are still referenced and thus couldn't be garbage collected

##### Ensuring GC

Although as mentioned above before a heapdump is taken all garbage is collected, I found that manually triggering
garbage collection and forcing the GC to compact yields better results. The reason for this is unclear to me.

Add the below snippet to your code which will only activate if you are exposing the garbage collector:

```js
// shortest
if (typeof gc === 'function') setTimeout(gc, 1000);

// longer in order to see indicators of gc being performed
if (typeof gc === 'function') {
  setTimeout(function doGC() { gc(); process.stdout.write(' gc ') }, 1000);
}
```

Then run your app with the appropriate flags to expose the gc and force compaction.

```
node --always-compact --expose-gc app.js
```

Now you can wait for the garbage collection to occur and take a heapdump right after.

Alternatively you can add a hook to your app, i.e. a route, that will trigger manual `gc` and invoke that before taking
a heapdump.

#### Considerations to make code easier to debug

The usefulness of the information presented in the below views depends on how you authored your code. Here are a few
rules to make your code more debuggable.

###### Name your function declarations

This requires little extra effort but makes is so much easier to track down which function is closing over an object and
thus prevents it from being collected. Unfortunately CoffeeScript generates JS that has unnamed functions due to a bug
in older Internet Explorers.

The below does **not** show as `foo` in the snapshot:

```js
var foo = function () { 
  [..]
}
```

This one will:

```js
var foo = function foo() { 
  [..]
}
```

This one as well:

```js
function foo() { 
  [..]
}
```


#### Views

##### Color Coding

[read](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/javascript-memory-profiling#looking-up-color-coding)

Properties and values are colored according to their types.

- *a:property* regular propertye, i.e. `foo.bar` 
- *0:element* numeric index property, i.e. `arr[0]`
- *a:context var* variable in function context, accessible by name from inside function closure
- *a:system prop* added by JS VM and not accessible from JS code, i.e. v8 internal objects
- yellow objects are referenced by JS
- red objects are detached nodes which are referenced by yellow background object

##### Summary View

[read](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/javascript-memory-profiling#summary-view)

- shows top level entries, a row per constructor
- columns for distance of the object to the *GC root*, number of object instances, shallow size and retained size.
- `@` character is objectsâ€™ unique ID, allowing you to compare heap snapshots on per-object basis

###### Limiting included Objects

- to the right of the View selector you can limit the objects by class name i.e. the name of the constructor function
- to the right of the class filter you can choose which objects to include in your summary (defaults to all)
  - select *objects allocated between heapdump 1 and heapdump 2* to identify objects that are still around in *heapdump
    3* but shouldn't be
  - another way to archieve similar results is by comparing two heapdumps (see below)

##### Comparison View

- compares multiple snapshots to each other
- used to find leaked objects
- after starting and completing (or canceling) the action, no garbage is left
- note that garbage is collected each time a snapshot is taken, therefore remaining items are still referenced


1. Take bottom line snapshot
2. Perform operation that might cause a leak
3. Perform reverse operation and/or ensure that action `2` is complete and therefore all objects needed to perform it
   should no longer be needed
4. Take second snapshot
5. Compare both snapshots, the *Size Delta* will tell you how much memory couldn't be collected

In more advanced scenarios you may take more snapshots and compare those.

##### Containment View

[read](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/javascript-memory-profiling#containment-view)

- birds eye view of apps object structure
- low level, allows peeking inside function closures and look at VM internal objects

###### Entry Points

- *GC roots* actual GC roots used by garbage collector
- *DOMWindow objects* (not present when profiling Node.js apps)
- *Native objects* (not present when profiling Node.js apps)

Additional entry points only present when profiling a Node.js app:

- *1::* global object
- *2::* global object
- *[4] Buffer* reference to Node.js Buffers

##### Dominators View

[read](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/javascript-memory-profiling#dominators-view)

- only available once *Settings/General/Profiler/Show advanced heap snapshot properties* is checked and browser
  refreshed afterwards
- shows dominators tree of heap
- similar to containment view but lacks property names since dominator may not have direct reference to all objects it
  dominates
- useful to identify memory accumulation points

##### Retainer View

- always shown at bottom of the UI
- displays retaining tree of currently selected object
- retaining tree has references going outward, i.e. inner item references outer item

#### Constructors listed in Views

[read](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/javascript-memory-profiling#memory-profiling-faq)

- *(global property)* intermediate object between global object and an object refereced by it
- *(roots)* root entries in retaining view are entities that reference the selected object
- *(closure)* count of references to a group of objects through function closures
- *(array, string, number, regexp)* list of object types with properties which reference an Array, String, Number or
  regular expression
- *(compiled code)* *SharedFunctionInfos* have no context and standibetween functions that do have context
