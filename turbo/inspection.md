# Inspecting v8

Multiple flags and so called _run time functions_ are available to anyone who likes to peek
into the inner workings of v8.

## Tracing Map Creation

- `--trace-maps` in combination with `--trace-maps-details` trace map generation into v8.log
- `--expose-gc` allows forcing GC via `gc()` in your code to see which maps are short lived
- the output can be parsed to see what maps _hidden classes_ and transitions into other maps v8
  creates to represent your objects
- a graphical presentation is also available by loading the resulting `v8.log` into
  `/v8/tools/map-processor.htm` (requires v8 checkout)

## Tracing Inline Caches

- `--trace-ic` dumps IC traces to the console

## Optimized Code

- `--print-opt-code` prints the actual optimized code that is generated by TurboFan
- `--code-comments` adds comments to printed optimized code
