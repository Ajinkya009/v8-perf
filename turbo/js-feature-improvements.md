## Function Bind

### Why Was Bind Slow?

- performance of `Function.prototype.bind` and `bound` functions suffered from performance
  issues in crankshaft days
- language boundaries C++/JS were crossed both ways which is expensive (esp.  calling back from
  C++ into JS)
- two temporary arrays were created on every invocation of a bound function
- dut to crankshaft limitations this couldn't be fixed easily there

### What Changed?

- entirely new approach to how _bound function exotic objects_ are implemented
- crossing C++/JS boundaries no longer needed
- pushing bound receiver and bound arguments directly and then calling target function allows
  futher compile time optimizations and enables inlining the target function into the
  caller
- resulted in **~400x** speed improvement

### Facit

- developers should use bound functions freely wherever they apply without having to worry
  about performance penalties

## instanceof and @@hasInstance

- latest JS allows overriding behavior of `instanceOf` via the `@@hasInstance` _well known
  symbol_
- na√≠vely this requires a check if `@@hasInstance` is defined for the given object every time
  `instanceof` is invoked for it (in 99% of the cases it won't be defined)
- initially that check was skipped as long as no overrides were added EVER (global protector
  cell)
- Node.js `Writable` class used `@@hasInstance` and thus incurred huge performance bottleneck
  for `instanceof` ~100x, since now checks were no longer skipped
- optimizations weren't possible in these cases initially
- by avoiding to depend on global protector cell for TurboFan and allowing inlining `instancof`
  code this performance bottleneck has been fixed

### Facit

- developers can use `instanceof` freely
- developers should think hard before overriding its behavior via `@@hasInstance` since this
  _magical behavior_ may confuse others, but using it will incurr no performance penalties
